# pands-myproject
Project for module Programming and Scripting
Author: Grace Mary Smyth.

Data Set:  Fisherâ€™s Iris data set
As specified in the description of the project as outlined by Anderw Beaty (Lecturer, ATU)

1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate.

For this assignment I have four parts, README file, .gitignore, analysis.py and a jupiter notebook called iris.ipnb
